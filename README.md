# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves examining the data to understand patterns, detect anomalies, and check assumptions. Key steps in the EDA process include:

Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics for numerical and categorical variables.
Visualization: Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize distributions and relationships.
Correlation Analysis: Correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features that might improve model performance.
Refer to notebooks/EDA.ipynb for detailed analysis and visualizations.

# Modeling
This section involves building and evaluating predictive models to forecast student performance. Steps include:

Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features based on EDA insights.
Model Training: Training various models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R^2 score.
Refer to notebooks/Modeling.ipynb for detailed modeling procedures and results.
